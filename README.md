# Bhoomi
Data driven hydroponic agriculture automation suite.

## What is Hydroponics?
Hydroponics is a soil-less agriculture methodology where the crops are cultivated in a water medium. All the nutrients and required favorable conditions are maintained in order to maximize the output and minimize the loss of crops.

Hydroponics comes from the ancient Greek formation of “hydro”, meaning water, and “ponics”, meaning labor. The water is doing the work here and enabling the fast growth of plants.

## Advantages of Hydroponics over traditional agriculture method.
1. Faster Growth
2. More and better yield
3. Free from chemical, organic in nature
4. Can be cultivated closer to markets
5. Not dependent on quality and quantity of land
6. Can be completely automated, controlled and monitored

## What is Bhoomi?

Framework to automate all the processes and steps involved in hydroponic agriculture.Its a pipeline management platform, that gives the farmer a holistic picture of the current conditions.

Smart actuator module, powered by ML algorithm to maintain the desired conditioning for the plants.
